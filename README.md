# Boid Algorithm Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Boid algorithm for simulating flocking behavior.

## Overview

The Boid algorithm is a behavioral model used to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. It was developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 and is based on three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion.

## Features

- Simulates flocking behavior of boids in a 2D environment.
- Adjustable parameters such as number of boids, maximum speed, and perception radius.
- Implemented using Python and Pygame library for visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RomiS08/Boid_Algorithm_STG.git

java


2. Install Pygame library (if not already installed):

pip install pygame

markdown


3. Run the simulation:

python boid_simulation.py

csharp
